## Control

Data masking should be used in accordance with the organization's topic-specific policy on access control and other related topic-specific policies, and business requirements, taking applicable legislation into consideration.

## Purpose

To limit the exposure of sensitive data including PII, and to comply with legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements.

## Guidance

Where the protection of sensitive data (e.g. PII) is a concern, the organization should consider hiding such data by using techniques such as data masking, pseudonymization or anonymization.

Pseudonymization or anonymization techniques can hide PII, disguise the true identity of PII principals or other sensitive information, and disconnect the link between PII and the identity of the PII principal or the link between other sensitive information.

When using pseudonymization or anonymization techniques, it should be verified that data has been adequately pseudonymized or anonymized. Data anonymization should consider all the elements of the sensitive information to be effective. As an example, if not considered properly, a person can be identified even if the data that can directly identify that person is anonymised, by the presence of further data which allows the person to be identified indirectly.

Additional techniques for data masking include:

a) encryption (requiring authorized users to have a key);
b) nulling or deleting characters (preventing unauthorized users from seeing full messages);
c) varying numbers and dates;
d) substitution (changing one value for another to hide sensitive data);
e) replacing values with their hash.

The following should be considered when implementing data masking techniques:

a) not granting all users access to all data, therefore designing queries and masks in order to show only the minimum required data to the user;
b) there are cases where some data should not be visible to the user for some records out of a set of data; in this case, designing and implementing a mechanism for obfuscation of data (e.g. if a patient does not want hospital staff to be able to see all of their records, even in case of emergency, then the hospital staff are presented with partially obfuscated data and data can only be accessed by staff with specific roles if it contains useful information for appropriate treatment);
c) when data are obfuscated, giving the PII principal the possibility to require that users cannot see if the data are obfuscated (obfuscation of the obfuscation; this is used in health facilities, for example if the patient does not want personnel to see that sensitive information such as pregnancies or results of blood exams has been obfuscated);
d) any legal or regulatory requirements (e.g. requiring the masking of payment cards' information during processing or storage).

The following should be considered when using data masking, pseudonymization or anonymization:

a) level of strength of data masking, pseudonymization or anonymization according to the usage of the processed data;
b) access controls to the processed data;
c) agreements or restrictions on usage of the processed data;
d) prohibiting collating the processed data with other information in order to identify the PII principal;
e) keeping track of providing and receiving the processed data.

## Other information

Anonymization irreversibly alters PII in such a way that the PII principal can no longer be identified directly or indirectly.

Pseudonymization replaces the identifying information with an alias. Knowledge of the algorithm (sometimes referred to as the "additional information") used to perform the pseudonymization allows for at least some form of identification of the PII principal. Such "additional information" should therefore be kept separate and protected.

While pseudonymization is therefore weaker than anonymization, pseudonymized datasets can be more useful in statistical research.

Data masking is a set of techniques to conceal, substitute or obfuscate sensitive data items. Data masking can be static (when data items are masked in the original database), dynamic (using automation and rules to secure data in real-time) or on-the-fly (with data masked in an application's memory).

Hash functions can be used in order to anonymize PII. In order to prevent enumeration attacks, they should always be combined with a salt function.

PII in resource identifiers and their attributes [e.g. file names, uniform resource locators (URLs)] should either be avoided or appropriately anonymized.

Additional controls concerning the protection of PII in public clouds are given in ISO/IEC 27018.

Additional information on de-identification techniques is available in ISO/IEC 20889.
