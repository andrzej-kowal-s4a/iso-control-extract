## Control

Networks and network devices should be secured, managed and controlled to protect information in systems and applications.

## Purpose

To protect information in networks and its supporting information processing facilities from compromise via the network.

## Guidance

Controls should be implemented to ensure the security of information in networks and to protect connected services from unauthorized access. In particular, the following items should be considered:

a) the type and classification level of information that the network can support;
b) establishing responsibilities and procedures for the management of networking equipment and devices;
c) maintaining up to date documentation including network diagrams and configuration files of devices (e.g. routers, switches);
d) separating operational responsibility for networks from ICT system operations where appropriate (see 5.3);
e) establishing controls to safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of data passing over public networks, third-party networks or over wireless networks and to protect the connected systems and applications (see 5.22, 8.24, 5.14 and 6.6). Additional controls can also be required to maintain the availability of the network services and computers connected to the network;
f) appropriately logging and monitoring to enable recording and detection of actions that can affect, or are relevant to, information security (see 8.16 and 8.15);
g) closely coordinating network management activities both to optimize the service to the organization and to ensure that controls are consistently applied across the information processing infrastructure;
h) authenticating systems on the network;
i) restricting and filtering systems connection to the network (e.g. using firewalls);
j) detecting, restricting and authenticating the connection of equipment and devices to the network;
k) hardening of network devices;
l) segregating network administration channels from other network traffic;
m) temporarily isolating critical subnetworks (e.g. with drawbridges) if the network is under attack;
n) disabling vulnerable network protocols.

The organization should ensure that appropriate security controls are applied to the use of virtualized networks. Virtualized networks also cover software-defined networking (SDN, SD-WAN). Virtualized networks can be desirable from a security viewpoint, since they can permit logical separation of communication taking place over physical networks, particularly for systems and applications that are implemented using distributed computing.

## Other information

Additional information on network security can be found in the ISO/IEC 27033 series.

More information concerning virtualized networks can be found in ISO/IEC TS 23167.
