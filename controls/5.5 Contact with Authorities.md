## Control

The organization should establish and maintain contact with relevant authorities.

## Purpose

To ensure appropriate flow of information takes place with respect to information security between the organization and relevant legal, regulatory and supervisory authorities.

## Guidance

The organization should specify when and by whom authorities (e.g. law enforcement, regulatory bodies, supervisory authorities) should be contacted and how identified information security incidents should be reported in a timely manner.

Contacts with authorities should also be used to facilitate the understanding about the current and upcoming expectations of these authorities (e.g. applicable information security regulations).

## Other information

Organizations under attack can request authorities to take action against the attack source.

Maintaining such contacts can be a requirement to support information security incident management (see 5.24 to 5.28) or the contingency planning and business continuity processes (see 5.29 and 5.30). Contacts with regulatory bodies are also useful to anticipate and prepare for upcoming changes in relevant laws or regulations that affect the organization. Contacts with other authorities include utilities, emergency services, electricity suppliers and health and safety [e.g. fire departments (in connection with business continuity), telecommunication providers (in connection with line routing and availability) and water suppliers (in connection with cooling facilities for equipment)].
