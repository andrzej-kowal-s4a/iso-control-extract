**Control type:** Information security properties  
**Cybersecurity concepts:** #Protect  
**Operational capabilities:** #Physical_security #Asset_management  
**Security domains:** #Preventive #Confidentiality #Integrity #Availability #Protection

## Control

Equipment should be sited securely and protected.

## Purpose

To reduce the risks from physical and environmental threats, and from unauthorized access and damage.

## Guidance

The following guidelines should be considered to protect equipment:

a) siting equipment to minimize unnecessary access into work areas and to avoid unauthorized access;
b) carefully positioning information processing facilities handling sensitive data to reduce the risk of information being viewed by unauthorized persons during their use;
c) adopting controls to minimize the risk of potential physical and environmental threats [e.g. theft, fire, explosives, smoke, water (or water supply failure), dust, vibration, chemical effects, electrical supply interference, communications interference, electromagnetic radiation and vandalism];
d) establishing guidelines for eating, drinking and smoking in proximity to information processing facilities;
e) monitoring environmental conditions, such as temperature and humidity, for conditions which can adversely affect the operation of information processing facilities;
f) applying lightning protection to all buildings and fitting lightning protection filters to all incoming power and communications lines;
g) considering the use of special protection methods, such as keyboard membranes, for equipment in industrial environments;
h) protecting equipment processing confidential information to minimize the risk of information leakage due to electromagnetic emanation;
i) physically separating information processing facilities managed by the organization from those not managed by the organization.
