## Control

Physical security for offices, rooms and facilities should be designed and implemented.

## Purpose

To prevent unauthorized physical access, damage and interference to the organization's information and other associated assets in offices, rooms and facilities.

## Guidance

The following guidelines should be considered to secure offices, rooms and facilities:

a) siting critical facilities to avoid access by the public;
b) where applicable, ensuring buildings are unobtrusive and give minimum indication of their purpose, with no obvious signs, outside or inside the building, identifying the presence of information processing activities;
c) configuring facilities to prevent confidential information or activities from being visible and audible from the outside. Electromagnetic shielding should also be considered as appropriate;
d) not making directories, internal telephone books and online accessible maps identifying locations of confidential information processing facilities readily available to any unauthorized person.

## Other information
