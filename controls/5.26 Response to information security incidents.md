## Control

Information security incidents should be responded to in accordance with the documented procedures.

## Purpose

To ensure efficient and effective response to information security incidents.

## Guidance

The organization should establish and communicate procedures on information security incident response to all relevant interested parties.

Information security incidents should be responded to by a designated team with the required competency (see 5.24).

The response should include the following:

a) containing, if the consequences of the incident can spread, the systems affected by the incident;
b) collecting evidence (see 5.28) as soon as possible after the occurrence;
c) escalation, as required including crisis management activities and possibly invoking business continuity plans (see 5.29 and 5.30);
d) ensuring that all involved response activities are properly logged for later analysis;
e) communicating the existence of the information security incident or any relevant details thereof to all relevant internal and external interested parties following the need-to-know principle;
f) coordinating with internal and external parties such as authorities, external interest groups and forums, suppliers and clients to improve response effectiveness and help to minimize consequences for other organizations;
g) once the incident has been successfully addressed, formally closing and recording it;
h) conducting information security forensic analysis, as required (see 5.28);
i) performing post-incident analysis to identify root cause. Ensure it is documented and communicated according to defined procedures (see 5.27);
j) identifying and managing information security vulnerabilities and weaknesses including those related to controls which have caused, contributed to or failed to prevent the incident.

## Other information
