## Control

Information security requirements should be identified, specified and approved when developing or acquiring applications.

## Purpose

To ensure all information security requirements are identified and addressed when developing or acquiring applications.

## Guidance

### General

Application security requirements should be identified and specified. These requirements are usually determined through a risk assessment. The requirements should be developed with the support of information security specialists.

Application security requirements can cover a wide range of topics, depending on the purpose of the application.

Application security requirements should include, as applicable:

a) level of trust in identity of entities [e.g. through authentication (see 5.17, 8.2 and 8.5)];
b) identifying the type of information and classification level to be processed by the application;
c) need for segregation of access and level of access to data and functions in the application;
d) resilience against malicious attacks or unintentional disruptions [e.g. protection against buffer overflow or structured query language (SQL) injections];
e) legal, statutory and regulatory requirements in the jurisdiction where the transaction is generated, processed, completed or stored;
f) need for privacy associated with all parties involved;
g) the protection requirements of any confidential information;
h) protection of data while being processed, in transit and at rest;
i) need to securely encrypt communications between all involved parties;
j) input controls, including integrity checks and input validation;
k) automated controls (e.g. approval limits or dual approvals);
l) output controls, also considering who can access outputs and its authorization;
m) restrictions around content of "free-text" fields, as these can lead to uncontrolled storage of confidential data (e.g. personal data);
n) requirements derived from the business process, such as transaction logging and monitoring, nonrepudiation requirements;
o) requirements mandated by other security controls (e.g. interfaces to logging and monitoring or data leakage detection systems);
p) error message handling.

### Transactional services

Additionally, for applications offering transactional services between the organization and a partner, the following should be considered when identifying information security requirements:

a) the level of trust each party requires in each other's claimed identity;
b) the level of trust required in the integrity of information exchanged or processed and the mechanisms for identification of lack of integrity (e.g. cyclic redundancy check, hashing, digital signatures);
c) authorization processes associated with who can approve contents of, issue or sign key transactional documents;
d) confidentiality, integrity, proof of dispatch and receipt of key documents and the non-repudiation (e.g. contracts associated with tendering and contract processes);
e) the confidentiality and integrity of any transactions (e.g. orders, delivery address details and confirmation of receipts);
f) requirements on how long to maintain a transaction confidential;
g) insurance and other contractual requirements.

### Electronic ordering and payment applications

Additionally, for applications involving electronic ordering and payment, the following should be considered:

a) requirements for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of order information;
b) the degree of verification appropriate to verify payment information supplied by a customer;
c) avoidance of loss or duplication of transaction information;
d) storing transaction details outside of any publicly accessible environment (e.g. on a storage platform existing on the organizational intranet, and not retained and exposed on electronic storage media directly accessible from the internet);
e) where a trusted authority is used (e.g. for the purposes of issuing and maintaining digital signatures or digital certificates) security is integrated and embedded throughout the entire end-to-end certificate or signature management process.

Several of the above considerations can be addressed by the application of cryptography (see 8.24), taking into consideration legal requirements (see 5.31 to 5.36, especially see 5.31 for cryptography legislation).

## Other information

Applications accessible via networks are subject to a range of network related threats, such as fraudulent activities, contract disputes or disclosure of information to the public; incomplete transmission, mis-routing, unauthorized message alteration, duplication or replay. Therefore, detailed risk assessments and careful determination of controls are indispensable. Controls required often include cryptographic methods for authentication and securing data transfer.

Further information on application security can be found in the ISO/IEC 27034 series.
