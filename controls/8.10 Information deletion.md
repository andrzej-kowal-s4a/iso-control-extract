# 8.10 Information deletion

**Control type:** Information security properties  
**Cybersecurity concepts:** #Protect  
**Operational capabilities:** #Information_protection #Legal_and_compliance  
**Security domains:** #Preventive #Confidentiality #Protection

## Control

Information stored in information systems, devices or in any other storage media should be deleted when no longer required.

## Purpose

To prevent unnecessary exposure of sensitive information and to comply with legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for information deletion.

## Guidance

### General

Sensitive information should not be kept for longer than it is required to reduce the risk of undesirable disclosure.

When deleting information on systems, applications and services, the following should be considered:

a) selecting a deletion method (e.g. electronic overwriting or cryptographic erasure) in accordance with business requirements and taking into consideration relevant laws and regulations;
b) recording the results of deletion as evidence;
c) when using service suppliers of information deletion, obtaining evidence of information deletion from them.

Where third parties store the organization's information on its behalf, the organization should consider the inclusion of requirements on information deletion into the third-party agreements to enforce it during and upon termination of such services.

### Deletion methods

In accordance with the organization's topic-specific policy on data retention and taking into consideration relevant legislation and regulations, sensitive information should be deleted when no longer required, by:

a) configuring systems to securely destroy information when no longer required (e.g. after a defined period subject to the topic-specific policy on data retention or by subject access request);
b) deleting obsolete versions, copies and temporary files wherever they are located;
c) using approved, secure deletion software to permanently delete information to help ensure information cannot be recovered by using specialist recovery or forensic tools;
d) using approved, certified providers of secure disposal services;
e) using disposal mechanisms appropriate for the type of storage media being disposed of (e.g. degaussing hard disk drives and other magnetic storage media).

Where cloud services are used, the organization should verify if the deletion method provided by the cloud service provider is acceptable, and if it is the case, the organization should use it, or request that the cloud service provider delete the information. These deletion processes should be automated in accordance with topic-specific policies, when available and applicable. Depending on the sensitivity of information deleted, logs can track or verify that these deletion processes have happened.

To avoid the unintentional exposure of sensitive information when equipment is being sent back to vendors, sensitive information should be protected by removing auxiliary storages (e.g. hard disk drives) and memory before equipment leaves the organization's premises.

Considering that the secure deletion of some devices (e.g. smartphones) can only be achieved through destruction or using the functions embedded in these devices (e.g. "restore factory settings"), the organization should choose the appropriate method according to the classification of information handled by such devices.

Control measures described in 7.14 should be applied to physically destroy the storage device and simultaneously delete the information it contains.

An official record of information deletion is useful when analysing the cause of a possible information leakage event.

## Other information

Information on user data deletion in cloud services can be found in ISO/IEC 27017.

Information on deletion of PII can be found in ISO/IEC 27555.
