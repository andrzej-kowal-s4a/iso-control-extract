## Control

Records should be protected from loss, destruction, falsification, unauthorized access and unauthorized release.

## Purpose

To ensure compliance with legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements, as well as community or societal expectations related to the protection and availability of records.

## Guidance

The organization should take the following steps to protect the authenticity, reliability, integrity and usability of records, as their business context and requirements for their management change over time:

a) issue guidelines on the storage, handling chain of custody and disposal of records, which includes prevention of manipulation of records. These guidelines should be aligned with the organization's topic-specific policy on records management and other records requirements;
b) draw up a retention schedule defining records and the period of time for which they should be retained.

The system of storage and handling should ensure identification of records and of their retention period taking into consideration national or regional legislation or regulations, as well as community or societal expectations, if applicable. This system should permit appropriate destruction of records after that period if they are not needed by the organization.

When deciding on protection of specific organizational records, their corresponding information security classification, based on the organization's classification scheme, should be considered. Records should be categorized into record types (e.g. accounting records, business transaction records, personnel records, legal records), each with details of retention periods and type of allowable storage media which can be physical or electronic.

Data storage systems should be chosen such that required records can be retrieved in an acceptable time frame and format, depending on the requirements to be fulfilled.

Where electronic storage media are chosen, procedures to ensure the ability to access records (both storage media and format readability) throughout the retention period should be established to safeguard against loss due to future technology change. Any related cryptographic keys and programs associated with encrypted archives or digital signatures, should also be retained to enable decryption of the records for the length of time the records are retained (see 8.24).

Storage and handling procedures should be implemented in accordance with recommendations provided by manufacturers of storage media. Consideration should be given to the possibility of deterioration of media used for storage of records.

## Other information

Records document individual events or transactions or can form aggregations that have been designed to document work processes, activities or functions. They are both evidence of business activity and information assets. Any set of information, regardless of its structure or form, can be managed as a record. This includes information in the form of a document, a collection of data or other types of digital or analogue information which are created, captured and managed in the course of business.

In the management of records, metadata is data describing the context, content and structure of records, as well as their management over time. Metadata is an essential component of any record.

It can be necessary to retain some records securely to meet legal, statutory, regulatory or contractual requirements, as well as to support essential business activities. National law or regulation can set the time period and data content for information retention. Further information about records management can be found in ISO 15489.
